# BURGERPORT RESTAURANT WEBSITE

A small team was put together for our Web Programming Course, where we
were required to create a mock website for a made up resturant of our choice.
We were only allowed to use HTML, CSS, and Javascript/JQuery.

On top of being the Team Lead for the project, the specific pages I was
resonponsible for were the Menu and Gift Card Pages. Each page was required to have some
sort of Javascript feature. As such, the Menu page incorperated a hidden menu that is revealed
when specific section of the menu is selected, while the Gift card page supports full
client-side form validation with DOM output messages.
